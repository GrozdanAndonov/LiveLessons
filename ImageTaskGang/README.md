This folder contains source code thats implement pattern-oriented
variants of the ImageTaskGangApplication from my Java Concurrency
LiveLessons tutorial using Java Executor framework concurrency
features, such as the ExecutorService and ExecutorCompletionService,
to download, process, store, & display images concurrently.

The original ImageTaskGangApplication was developed as a single code
base that worked both as an Android app and a Java console
app. However, this implementation only worked with Eclipse, which is
increasingly obsolete. Therefore, this new version splits (and
enhances) the code base to provide a command-line version of the app
packaged as a gradle project that compares/contrasts the performance
of different Java Executor framework concurrency models.
