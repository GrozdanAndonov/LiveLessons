This directory contains examples where clients use Spring WebMVC
features to perform remote method invocations from a client to a
server over HTTP.

Here's an overview of what's currently included in these examples:

. ex1 - This example shows how Spring WebMVC can be used to send and
        receive HTTP GET requests via the Java parallel streams
        framework, the completable futures framework, and the Java
        structured concurrency frameworks.  These requests are mapped
        to methods that determine the primality of large Integer
        objects.

. ex2 - This example shows how Spring WebMVC can be used to obtain
        quotes from Yogi Berra in various ways.

. ex3 - This example demonstrate Java's structured concurrency
        frameworks using two Spring WebMVC microservices that (1)
        check the primality of a List of random Integer objects and
        (2) compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of pairs of
        these Integer objects.

. ex4 - This example demonstrates the ability to use Spring WebMVC
        features, including the Jakarta Persistence API in conjunction
        with Spring server-side caching, so a client using the Spring
        Cloud API gateway to interact with two microservices that
        provide quotes from Zippy th' Pinhead and Jack Handey.

. ex5 - This program tests the features of the LockManagerApplication
        microservice, which uses Spring WebMVC to provide a
        distributed lock manager for synchronous Spring client
        applications using quasi-asynchronous controller methods that
        return Spring DeferredResult objects.  It also shows how to
        use the synchronous HTTP interface features in Spring
        framework 6, which enables the definition of declarative HTTP
        services using Java interfaces.

. ex6 - This example shows the use of Spring WebMVC to apply Java
        sequential and parallel streams to process entries in a
        recursively-structured directory folder sequentially and/or
        concurrently in a client/server environment.  This example
        also shows how to encode/decode complex objects that use
        inheritance relationships and transmits them between
        processes.
