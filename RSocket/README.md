This directory contains all the RSocket source code examples that use
Spring, Project Reactor, the Reactive Relational Database Connector
(R2DBC), and various AI features (including the Stanford coreNLP
library and ChatGPT).  Here's an overview of what's included:

. ex1 - This program applies reactive programming capabilities to
        implement a client/server application that demonstrates four
        RSocket interaction models in the context of providing Zippy
        th' Pinhead quotes.

. ex2 - This program applies reactive programming capabilities to
        implement a client/server application that demonstrates the
        use of backpressure and R2DBC in the context of providing
        Zippy th' Pinhead and Jack Handey quotes.

. ex3 - This program applies reactive programming capabilities to
        implement a client/server application that demonstrates the
        use of ChatGPT and the Stanford coreNLP library to perform
        sentiment analysis on famous quotes from William Shakespeare.
